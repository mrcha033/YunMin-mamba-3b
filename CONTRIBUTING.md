## Running Tests

The unit tests require a few optional libraries that are not installed by default.
Before executing `pytest`, install `transformers` and `mamba-ssm`:

```bash
pip install transformers mamba-ssm
```

After installing the dependencies, run the test suite from the repository root:

```bash
pytest
```
